# **Hospital Data Analysis: Case Study**  

## **Overview**  
This case study analyzes hospital data from **January 2023 to March 2025**, focusing on patient admissions, treatment costs, satisfaction levels, and readmission rates. The goal is to identify key trends, inefficiencies, and actionable insights to improve hospital operations and patient care.  

---  

## **Key Insights**  

### **1. Patient Flow and Hospital Efficiency**  
- **Peak Admission Periods:** Highest admissions occurred in **December, January, and February (Winter season)**, indicating seasonal trends (e.g., flu season).  
- **Average Length of Stay:** **7.62 days**  
  - **Neurology**: **8.08 days** (longest LOS, indicating inefficiency or severe cases).  
  - **Cardiology**: **6.97 days** (shortest LOS, indicating efficiency).  
- **Department Performance:**  
  - **Pediatrics** had the highest number of admissions.  
  - **Neurology** had the highest treatment costs per patient.  

### **2. Readmission Trends**  
- **By Department:**  
  - **Pediatrics**: **16 out of 49 patients** were readmitted (highest readmission rate).  
  - **Cardiology**: **8 out of 35 patients** were readmitted (lowest readmission rate).  
- **By Diagnosis:**  
  - **Stroke**: **14 out of 39 patients** readmitted (highest).  
  - **Diabetes**: **14 out of 51 patients** readmitted (second highest).  
  - **Fracture**: **11 out of 33 patients** readmitted (lowest).  
- **Key Finding:** High readmission rates indicate possible **incomplete recovery or inadequate post-discharge care**.  

### **3. Financial Insights**  
- **Treatment Costs:**  
  - **Average Cost per Patient**: **$8,945**  
  - **Neurology**: **$9,850** (highest, due to advanced procedures).  
  - **Cardiology**: **$8,059** (lowest).  
  - **Heart Disease**: **$10,498** (highest per diagnosis).  
- **Insurance Coverage Impact:**  
  - **54 patients** had **low insurance coverage (<51%)**, leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses.  
  - Patients with **low insurance coverage** had a lower **satisfaction score (6.8/10)**.  
  - Patients with **high insurance coverage (>80%)** had a **higher satisfaction score (8.4/10)**.  
- **Revenue Generation:**  
  - **Pediatrics** generated the most revenue: **$452,197**.  

### **4. Recovery Trends**  
- **Fast vs. Slow Recovery:**  
  - Patients with **LOS â‰¤ 3 days** had a **low readmission rate (7%)**, meaning effective treatment.  
  - Patients with **LOS > 7 days** had a **high readmission rate (13%)**, signaling potential complications.  

### **5. Patient Satisfaction**  
- **Overall Satisfaction Score:** **7.60/10**  
- **Factors Affecting Satisfaction:**  
  - **Higher Treatment Costs â†’ Lower Satisfaction:** Patients were less satisfied with expensive treatments.  
  - **Longer Length of Stay â†’ Lower Satisfaction:** Patients disliked extended hospital stays.  
  - **Department Satisfaction:**  
    - **Cardiology**: **7.79/10** (highest satisfaction).  
    - **Neurology**: **Lowest satisfaction score.**

## **Recommendations**  

### **1. Optimize Length of Stay:**  
- Implement faster discharge procedures in **Neurology** to reduce unnecessary hospitalization costs.  
- Introduce **better post-discharge care** to reduce readmissions.  

### **2. Improve Insurance Coverage & Affordability:**  
- Educate patients on **insurance options** to increase coverage adoption.  
- Offer **flexible payment plans** for uninsured patients.  

### **3. Enhance Patient Experience:**  
- Improve **post-discharge care plans** to lower readmissions.  
- Train hospital staff to increase satisfaction scores in **low-performing departments**.  

### **4. Seasonal Readiness Strategy:**  
- **Increase staff & resources** during **Winter (December â€“ February)** to manage high patient inflows.  
- **Allocate extra ICU beds** and emergency staff during peak admission months.
